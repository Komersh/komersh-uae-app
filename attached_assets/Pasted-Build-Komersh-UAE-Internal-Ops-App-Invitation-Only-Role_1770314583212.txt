Build “Komersh UAE Internal Ops App” (Invitation-Only, Role-Based) Overview Build a private internal web app for Komersh UAE used by two founders (one in Germany, one in UAE) to manage the end-to-end process of: Finding potential products Buying inventory from AliExpress/other sites Tracking shipment/warehouse status Logging sales/orders (Amazon UAE, Noon, Komersh.ae, etc.) Tracking expenses, revenue, profit Managing tasks in a Kanban board with email reminders Viewing a dashboard with business health + metrics The app must be invitation-only (admin invites users by email), with role-based permissions so we can add marketing people or helpers and restrict what they can see/do. 1) Authentication & Access Login & Invitations Users can only register if they receive an email invite from an admin. Login by email + password (or magic link optional). Admin can: Invite user (email) Assign role Enable/disable user access Roles & Permissions (RBAC) At minimum: Admin (full access) Founder/Manager (almost full access, no user management optional) Marketing (view only certain pages + add marketing expenses) Warehouse/Operations (update product statuses, view inventory) Viewer (read-only dashboards) Permissions should be modular per section: Products: view / create / edit / buy / mark sold / update status Financial: view / create expenses / edit entries Tasks: view / create / edit / move cards / delete Dashboard: view 2) App Sections (Main Navigation) Section A: Dashboard (Home) A high-level dashboard that shows: Total inventory value (cost) Total sales revenue Total profit (overall + monthly) Expenses (monthly + breakdown) Inventory status overview (Shipped / In Warehouse / Sold) Low-stock alerts Top profitable products Tasks overview (overdue / due today / upcoming) Recent activity log (who did what) Section B: Products Products module has 2 main subsections: B1) Potential Products (Research List) A table/list to add product ideas before buying. Fields per potential product: Product name/title Supplier link (AliExpress/other) Supplier/store name Product image (upload or paste URL) Variations (color/size optional) Cost per unit (with currency) Suggested buy quantity Estimated shipping cost (optional) Target selling price (optional) Marketplace (Amazon UAE / Noon / Komersh.ae) Notes “Buy rating” 1–5 stars (or score system) Status: Researching / Ready to buy / Rejected / Bought Table needs: Search + filter + sort (rating, price, status, marketplace) Actions: Edit / Delete BUY button → opens popup/modal: Enter quantity purchased Unit price (default from cost per unit; editable) Total price auto-calculated Purchase date Optional: shipping cost, supplier order ID Confirm → moves item into “Purchased Products / Inventory” and creates an “inventory batch” record. B2) Purchased Products / Inventory Tracking Shows all products that were bought and where they are. Each inventory item needs: Product image Product name Quantity purchased (current available) Unit cost + total cost Purchase date Status tracking: Ordered Shipped In transit Arrived UAE In warehouse Listed Sold out Warehouse location (optional) Supplier order ID / tracking number (optional) Notes Actions: Update Status (dropdown) ORDER / SOLD button (when you make a sale): Popup modal: Channel: Amazon UAE / Noon / Komersh.ae / Other Quantity sold Selling price per unit (or total) Marketplace fees (optional) Shipping cost (optional) Date of sale On confirm: Reduce inventory quantity Create a financial “order/sale” record linked to this product Profit for that sale is calculated automatically Rules: Cannot sell more than available quantity When quantity hits 0 → mark “Sold out” Section C: Financial Financial module has 3 subsections: C1) Expenses (Monthly + Categories) Track every expense with date, category, and which country/account paid it. Expense fields: Date Month (auto derived) Category (Subscription / Marketing / Shipping / Warehouse / Tools / Misc) Description Amount Currency (USD/AED/EUR) Paid by (Germany / UAE / Company / Person A / Person B) Payment method (Bank / Cash / Card optional) Attachment upload (invoice/receipt optional) Views: Monthly summary cards (total expenses per month) Category breakdown Filter by date range, category, paid-by C2) Orders / Sales (Revenue) All sales records created from “ORDER / SOLD” in Products appear here.

Suggested stack (choose one): Option 1 (Simple & Fast): Frontend: React + Tailwind Backend: Node.js/Express DB: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for MVP) Auth: Email invite tokens + hashed passwords (bcrypt) Email: SendGrid/Mailgun/Resend (API) Option 2 (Very clean all-in-one): Next.js (fullstack) Prisma ORM PostgreSQL NextAuth (with invite-only restriction) Email provider integration 6) Data Model (Minimum Entities) Users (email, name, role, active) Roles/Permissions PotentialProducts InventoryBatches (purchased lots) InventoryStatusHistory (optional) SalesOrders (linked to inventory) Expenses Accounts (cash/bank/payout) Transactions (optional, to track money movement) Tasks TaskComments ActivityLog Attachments 7) MVP First (build in phases) Phase 1 (MVP): Invite-only auth + roles Potential Products + Buy → Inventory Inventory + Sold → Sales records + quantity deduction Expenses Basic dashboard metrics Kanban tasks + due date reminders Phase 2: Accounts/cashflow + payout tracking Multi-currency conversion Advanced analytics (top sellers, ROI per product) CSV import/export
